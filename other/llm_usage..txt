Hereâ€™s an example of how you can cite the Spotify Web API documentation in your .bib file:

@manual{spotifyAPI,
  title        = {Spotify Web API Documentation},
  author       = {{Spotify Developers}},
  year         = {2024},
  url          = {https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api},
  note         = {Accessed: 2024-11-21}
}
Explanation:
@manual: Used for technical documentation or manuals.
title: The title of the documentation.
author: The name of the author(s) or organization responsible for the documentation.
year: The year you accessed or used the documentation.
url: The URL for the online documentation.
note: Additional details, such as the access date.
You can replace the year and access date as appropriate for your project.
